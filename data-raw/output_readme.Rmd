This is an OpenTripPlanner graph for planning trips, by car or public transport, between places in Wales - including where these trips involve a short journey entirely within England. (It likely also works well enough for planning trips between places in Wales and a small number of English towns just the other side of the border.)

The map shows bus and train routes included in the latest graph, giving a rough idea of the region included.

You can [download the latest release of the Wales-ish OTP graph here](https://github.com/stupidpupil/wales_ish_otp_graph/releases/latest).

You can [see the scripts used to download source data and generate this graph here](https://github.com/stupidpupil/wales_ish_otp_graph). These depend enormously on the [UK2GTFS R package](https://itsleeds.github.io/UK2GTFS/) and the [Osmium tool](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/).

## Update
The graph file was last updated at `r file.mtime("output/graph.obj")  %>% strftime("%H:%M %Z on %d %B %Y", tz="Europe/London")`.

It was prepared using the following version of OpenTripPlanner - ``r otp_version()``{style="white-space:normal;"} - running on the following version of Java - ``r java_version()``.
